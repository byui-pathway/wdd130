    <p>Hello everybody! I hail from Gauteng, South Africa. I was born in Cape Town, South Africa but was raised most of
        my life in Gauteng, South Africa. I have 5 siblings and I am the oldest of the six of us. I can truely say that
        I have been born of goodly parents.
    </p>
    <p>I was born and raised in the Church but I officially joined in the year 2010. I have loved learning about
        disciples of Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ from the scriptures when studying it in seminary. I also have amazing
        memories from singing time in primary.</p>
    <p>I am currently working as a music teacher, I play the piano and violin and have come to enjoy my new found hobby
        of knitting. How I became interested in pursuing a degree in Applied technology was when seeing my dad studying
        this degree I would see how websites and programs are put together and I find it so cool to see how everything
        works together to bring the apps, websites, and technology that we use today. I am super excited to get to know
        the class and see what I can learn from this course. Thanks you for viewing my page.</p>
